The purpose of this project is to define a set of [data sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/data-sources.html)
that make it easier to find the resources managed by SUSE on the different public clouds.

The provider gathers data by accessing the public instance of
[public-cloud-info-service](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/public-cloud-info-service)
managed by SUSE.

You can find more information about the resources managed by SUSE on the public clouds
here:

* [Blog post](https://www.suse.com/c/riddle-me-this/)
* [Offical cli tool](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/public-cloud-info-client)

## Using the Provider

### Data source `susepubliccloud_image_ids`

Use this data source to get a list of image IDs matching
the specified criteria.

Example use:

```hcl
data "susepubliccloud_image_ids" "sles" {
  cloud      = "amazon"
  region     = "eu-central-1"
  state      = "active"
  name_regex = "suse-sles-15-sp1-byos.*-hvm-ssd-x86_64"
}

resource "aws_instance" "control_plane" {
  ami = "${data.susepubliccloud_image_ids.sles.ids[0]}"
  ...
}
```

#### Argument reference

* `cloud` - (Required) Name of the target cloud to use. Valid values: `amazon`,
  `google`, `microsoft` and `oracle`.
* `region` - (Required) One of the known regions in the cloud framework. Use the
  region identifiers as the provider describes them, for example `us-east-1` in
  Amazon EC2, or `East US 2` in Microsoft Azure.
* `state` - (Defaults to `active`) State of the image. Valid values:
  `active`, `inactive`, `deprecated`. Note well: the `deleted` state isn't
  accepted by the data source because these images would not be usable by
  terraform.
* `name_regex` - (Optional) A regex string to apply to the images list returned
  by the remote API managed by SUSE.
* `sort_ascending` - (Defaults to `false`) Used to sort by publication time.

**Note well:** the values accepted by `cloud`, `region` and `state` are the ones
specified [here](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/public-cloud-info-service#server-design).

#### Attributes reference

`ids` is set to the list of images IDs, sorted by publication time according to
`sort_ascending`.

## Installing the Provider

This provider is published on the official [terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SUSE/susepubliccloud/latest), that makes
the provider installable by terraform. This is definitely the easiest way to go.

You can find more information about that by clicking on the "USE PROVIDER" button on the [terraform registry page](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SUSE/susepubliccloud/latest).

### RPM packages

openSUSE and SUSE packages are being built inside of the
[systemsmanagement:terraform terraform-provider-susepubliccloud](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:terraform/terraform-provider-susepubliccloud)
project on the [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/).

The packages can be installed by visiting the [dedicated page](https://software.opensuse.org/package/terraform-provider-susepubliccloud?search_term=terraform-provider-susepubliccloud)
on [software.opensuse.org](https://software.opensuse.org).

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll need:

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10+
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.12 (to build the provider plugin)

*Note:* This project uses [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) making it safe to work with it outside of your existing [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH (i.e `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`).

Clone repository to: `$HOME/development/terraform-providers/`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/; cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
$ git clone git@github.com:SUSE/terraform-provider-susepubliccloud
...
```

To compile the provider execute the following command:

```sh
$ make build
```

This will produce the `terraform-provider-susepubliccloud` binary that can be
copied to your `~/.terraform.d/plugins/<GOOS>_<GOARCH>` directory.

More instructions about how to instead use a custom-built provider in your
Terraform environment can be found
[here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin).

### Testing

Unit tests can be run via:

```sh
$ make test
```

Unit test coverage can be seen by executing:

```sh
$ make test-coverage
```

Code can be linted via:

```sh
$ make lint
```
